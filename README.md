# Solving Maze Environment with various Reinforcement Learning Approaches
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning module coursework repository!

This project is a demonstration of the application of reinforcement learning techniques to solve a maze environment modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), both with Model-Based and Model-Free methods.

In this project, you will find:

A description of the maze environment and how it was modeled as an MDP.
A detailed explanation of the reinforcement learning algorithms and techniques used to solve the maze environment, including dynamic programming (value iteration and policy iteration), Monte-Carlo reinforcement learning (every-visit and first-visit), and temporal difference reinforcement learning (Q-learning and SARSA).
A comparison of the different reinforcement learning methods, including plots to illustrate the outcomes.
The source code for the project, including any necessary dependencies and instructions for running the code.
We hope that this project will serve as a useful reference for those interested in applying reinforcement learning techniques to solve real-world problems. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

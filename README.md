# Solving Maze Environment with various Reinforcement Learning Approaches
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning module coursework repository!

This project is a demonstration of the application of reinforcement learning techniques to solve a maze environment modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), both with Model-Based and Model-Free methods.

In this project, you will find:

  - A description of the maze environment and how it was modelled as an MDP.
  - Source code and detailed comparison of various Reinforcement Learning strategies used to solve the maze environment, includig 
        - **Dynamic Programming** (Value iteration vs Policy Iteration) 
        - **Monte Carlo** (Every-Visit MC vs First-Visit MC)
        - **Temporal Difference** (SARSA on-policy vs Q-Learning off-policy)
  -  Source code used for visualisations and plots.
  -  Final Project Report, attaining a distinction.

We hope that this project will serve as a useful reference for those interested in applying Reinforcement Learning techniques to solve real-world problems. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
